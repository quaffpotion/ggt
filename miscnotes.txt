	For the result to go through we require:
		1) Core
			1) simply connected
			2) cocompact

		2) Splitting
			1)  edge spaces must be injective on fundamental group

	Current:
		Expect 1.1 to come from showing pre-images of hyperplanes have connected components that are simply connected. 
		Expect 1.2 (unknown)
		Expect 2.1 This comes from 1.1

	Candidate core:
		The core for two trees has you remove light quadrants. Continue in this fashion removing only quadrants (as opposed to octants)
		i.e. we remove sets like d1 x d2 x T3 x T4 x ... x Tn as opposed to ``octants'' d1 x d2 x ... x dn. Compare with the characterization Guirardel works out for his core where it's the minimal subcomplex with convex (projection onto a tree) fibers - we would check against projecting onto all but one tree.

	Consequences of requirements:
		1) Item (1) implies our group is the fundamental group of a VHD-complex
		2) Assuming cd 3, our group can't have more than three splittings
