\section{Problem Statement}


We want to show the following statement or similar: if a group is the fundamental group of a VH-complex, then there are at most two pairwise inequivalent actions on locally finite trees with FP vertex stabilizers. The following proof sketch uses or builds on VH-complexes introduced by Wise, Guirardel's core, and a theorem of Bieri. To start we have that \(G = \pi_1(K)\) where \(K\) is a VH-complex; according to Wise this comes with a vertical and horizontal splitting. For sake of a contradiction suppose there was a third tree as above. A generalization of Guirardel's core to three actions would imply that our \(G\) was the fundamental group of a VHD-complex (here ``D'' is for ``depth'') which would further imply, among other things, that our group splits along groups of cohomological dimension two. (This is analagous to Wise's work on VH-complexes) However, a theorem of Bieri and local finiteness forces the cohomological dimension of the resulting group to be dimension three which contradicts our original VH assumption so there are at most two such actions.

\subsection{Definitions}

\begin{defn}
	[Type \(FP\) ]
	A group is of type \(FP\) if it is (1) type \(FP_n\) for all \(n\) and (2) finite geometric cohomological dimension.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	[Finite Type] 
	An action of {\em finite type} is one on a locally finite tree where  vertex stabilizers are of type FP.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[open Direction] An open direction is a connected component of an \(\mathbb{R}\)-tree minus a point. 
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Closed Direction] A closed directon is a connected component of an \(\mathbb{R}\)-tree minus a point, union that point.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[Open Halfspace] An open halfspace is an open direction obtained from deleting the midpoint of an edge.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[Closed Halfspace] A closed halfspace is a closed direction obtained from deleting the midpoint of an edge.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[Halfspaces of a product] An open (resp. closed) halfspace of a product (at a certain index) is a subset where one projection is an open (resp. closed)  halfspace in it's factor and the others are onto.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[Generalized quadrants] A generalized open (resp. closed) quadrant with respect to a product of \(k\) spaces is an intersection of \(k\) open (resp. closed) product halfspaces where each one is at a different index.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[cellular-product-convex] We say that \(K \subset X\) is cellular-product-convex if it's complement is the open cellular neighborhood of a union of generalized closed quadrants.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
	[Filling]
	Let \(\{X_{k}\}_{k}\) be a family of spaces where one can take convex hulls. Given \(S \subseteq X := \prod X_{k}\) define \(S_{k}\) via: \[p \in S_{k} \iff \exists \,q,r \in S: \forall j \neq k: p_{j} = q_{j} = r_{j} \text{ and } p_{k} \in \pi_{k} (\{q_{k} , r_{k}\}).\] 
\end{defn}

\subsection{Misc Statements}

\begin{lem}
    [Filling Lemma in \(\mathbb{R}^{2}\)]
	\label{lem:fillr2}
	If \(R \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{2}\) is connected, then \(\rxy\) is 1-dim fiber convex.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
    (sketch) This one is miai with a line that's left out
\end{proof}
\begin{lem}
    [Filling Lemma in \(T_{1} \times T_{2}\)]
	\label{lem:fillt2}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
    (sketch) find replace the proof in \(\mathbb{R}^{2}\) with corresponding words for trees e.g. connecting becomes convex hull, left becomes inside a half space etc.
\end{proof}


\section{Outline and notation for the construction of the core}

	From Guirardel we get a map from the universal cover of our VH complex to the product of three trees by taking inclusion in the first two factors and Guirardel's map in the last factor. We obtain \(S = \text{Im}(f)\) and will show it's cocompact. Then we put \(K = \text{hull}{S}\) and show it's still cocompact. Finally we fill \(K\) in all three directions obtaining the core \(C\). Again, this needs to be cocompact. The main goal is to show that \(C\) is actually QC as well so that we get a legitimate graph of spaces decomposition of \(G\).

\section{Octant Convexity of the core}
\begin{thm}
    [\label{thm:QCOC}Slices QC implies OC for trees]
	Let \(X=T_{1} \times T_{2} \times T_{3}\) where each \(T_{i}\) is a locally finite tree. Let \(K\) be a subcomplex of \(X\) that satisfies: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item connected
		\item has connected hyperplanes
		\item has cellular-product-convex hyperplanes 
	\end{itemize}
Then \(K\) is also cellular-product-convex.
\end{thm}
We need four lemmas, the last two give the implication after taking intersections:

\begin{lem}
	[\label{lem:cubeOC}Cube OC] Let \(S \subseteq \mathbb{E}  \) be a closed set such that \(S\) satisfies: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \((0,0,0) \not\in S\) 
		\item \(S\) connected
		\item \(S \cap (\text{coordinate-plane})\) is connected.
		\item \(S \cap (\text{coordinate-plane})\) is disjoint from some closed quadrant in that plane.
	\end{enumerate}
	Then \(S\) is disjoint from some closed octant of \(\mathbb{E}\). 
	\begin{proof}
		(todo, should follow from notes on the \(\mathbb{R}^{3}\) case.)
	\end{proof}
\end{lem}

\begin{lem}
	[\label{lem:Xtocube}X to cube]
	If \(S\) satisfies the hypotheses of \ref{thm:QCOC} then \(\rho S\) satisfies the hypotheses of \ref{lem:cubeOC} provided \(\rho\) is a projection map to a cube determined by a midpoint disjoint from \(S\).
\begin{proof}
	(todo)	
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

\begin{lem}
	[Connecting logic]
	If \(\rho S\) satisfies the conclusion of lemma \ref{lem:cubeOC} for each cube disjoint from \(S\), then \(S\) satisfies the conclusion of theorem \ref{thm:QCOC}.
\end{lem}


\section{Proving core is hyperplane QC}
One path is to show that \(C\) is 1-dimensional fiberwise connected and then apply Guirardel's lemma in each hyperplane to conclude that they're QC as needed.

\begin{lem}
	[Guirardel Lemma 5.4, Corollary 5.5]
	Let \(T_{1} , T_{2}\) be two \(\mathbb{R}\)-trees and let \(F\) be a nonempty connected subset of \(T_{1} \times T_{2}\) with convex fibers. Then the complement of \(\overline{F}\) is a union of quadrants. That is, \(\overline{F}\) is also nonempty, connected, and has convex fibers.
\end{lem}

\begin{lem}
	[Coloring Lemma]
	Let \(T\) be a finite combinatorial tree with a valence one vertex \(x_{0}\). Let \((\sigma_{i} )_{i=1}^{i=N}\) be a sequence of non-degenerate edgepaths and let \(p = *_{i=1}^{i=N} \sigma_{i}\) be a loop based at \(x_{0}\). Let \(\lambda\) be a function from \(\{(\sigma_{i} , i )\}_{i=1}^{i=N}\) to a non-empty finite set such that \(\lambda (1) \neq \lambda (N)\). Suppose that \(x_{0} \in \{\delta_{0} \sigma_{i} , \delta_{1} \sigma_{i} \} \implies i \in \{1,N\}\). Let \(A\) be the set of endpoints minus the basepoint \(x_{ 0}\). Then there exists some \(a \in A\) such that for all edges \(e\) in the geodesic \([x_{0} , a]\) there exist some \(i, j\) such that \(\sigma_{i}\) and \(\sigma_{j}\) intersect \(\{e,\overline{e}\}\) and \(\lambda ( i ) \neq \lambda ( j )\).

	\begin{proof}
		Suppose this were false, then WLOG we could form a counterexample \(K = (T,x_{0}, \sigma_{1} \cdots \sigma_{N} , e_{1} , \ldots, e_{m})\) such that (1) \(\lambda\) is constant on the subpaths using a given \(e_{i}\), (2) the edges separate \(x_{0}\) from \(A\), and (3) for every \(e_{ i}\) there is some \(\sigma_{j}\) such that each halfspace of \(e_{i}\) contains exactly one endpoint of \(\sigma_{j}\). Define the complexity \(c\) of such an example as the sum of the number of times an \(e_{i}\) is {\em straddled} as in (3). Because edges are separating, \(c\) must be even. 

		We will call the \(e_{1},\ldots,e_{N}\) {\em bad} edges. A bad edge is {\em outer} if it's halfspace not containing \(x_{0}\) doesn't contain any bad edges.


		Next we will define a {\em snip} on \(K\). Pick a bad edge \(e\)  of \(K\), let \(i\) and \(j\) be the first and next \(\sigma_{i}\) and \(\sigma_{j}\) that straddle \(e\). Form \(\sigma_{i}'\) by taking the longest initial segment of \(\sigma_{i}\) that doesn't use \(e\) and \(\sigma_{j} '\) by taking the longest tail segment of \(\sigma_{j}\) that doesn't use \(e\). Form \(p'\) by replacing the \(\sigma\)'s with \(\sigma '\)'s.
		\begin{claim*}Performing a snip on an outer edge of \(K\) produces a new counterexample of complexity \(c'=c-2\).

		\end{claim*}
	\end{proof}
\end{lem}

\begin{lem}
	[Well-defined filling \(\mathbb{R}^{3}\) ]

	If \(S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{3}\) is connected in all coordinate planes then \(S_x\), \(S_{y}\), and \(S_{z}\) are as well. 
	

\end{lem}

\begin{lem}
	[Switching Lemma in \(\mathbb{R}^{3}\) ]
	 \label{lem:switch} 
	 If \(S\) is connected in all \(xy\)-planes, then \((S_{x})_{y} = (S_{y})_{x}\).
	
\end{lem}
\begin{lem}
    [Filling Lemma in \(\mathbb{R}^{3}\)]
	\label{lem:fillr3}
	If \(S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{3}\) is itself connected and connected in all coordinate planes, then \(\sxyz\) is 1-dim fiber convex.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
    (sketch) Need to use the Guirardel lemma to get two ways of writing the quadrant-convex hull of a set. This allows switching. Then assuming things are connected in all planes get that one filling is still connected and so you can apply the switching again. (There is a planar path argument to make) Then you get the result.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}
	Let \(S\) be as above. Consider \(S_{ y}\) and a slice of \(S_{ y}\) given by the intersection of \(S_{ y}\) with some \(xz\)-plane. If a point in the slice is in \(S_{y} \smallsetminus   S\) then by the definition of filling there exists two points, each with different \(y\)-coordinates but the same coordinates in our \(xz\)-plane, on either side. Consider the line that's the intersection of our \(xz\)-plane and the \(xy\)-plane containing our point. This line must contain an element of \(S\) else \(S\) wouldn't be connected in \(xy\)-planes. Consider the \(xy\)-plane containing our three points of \(S\) so far. We will say points with \(x\)-coordinates greater than our red point 
\end{proof}
\begin{lem}
    [Filling Lemma in \(T_{1} \times T_{2} \times T_{3}\)]
	\label{lem:fillt3}
    (Here we're taking convex hulls in the tree factors)
\begin{proof}
    (todo)
\end{proof}
\end{lem}
