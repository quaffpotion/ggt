\section{Background}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Group Splittings
    
        Classical combinatorial group theory gives an algebraic notion of gluing groups along subgroups. Using suitable spaces and Siefert-van Kampen's theorem one can interpret the gluing as taking the quotient of a topological space. In the definitions below, amalgamation and HNN extension from the point of view of topology correspond to the disconnected and connected case. (e.g. An HNN extension along an automorphism is the fundamental group of a mapping torus) For a different kind of intuition note that an amalgamated free product is the pushout in the category of groups.
        
        Given \(A\leq G\) and \(B\leq H\) and an isomorphism \(\phi:A\to B\) and another isomorphism \(\psi: C\to C\) where \(C\leq G\) we can form the {\em amalgamated free product of \(G\) and \(H\) along \(\phi\)} denoted \(A*_\phi B\) with presentation \(\langle G, H\mid \phi(a) = b, a\in A\rangle\) and the {\em HNN extension of \(G\) along \(\psi\)} denoted \(G*_\psi\) with presentation \(\langle G, t\mid \psi(c)=tct^{-1}, c\in C\rangle\). 
        
        We will use results from Bass-Serre theory which gives a correspondence between splittings and \(G\)-trees. Roughly speaking, the groups in the amalgamation or HNN extension appear as vertex and edge stabilizers and vice versa.
    \item Daniel Wise VH-complexes
    
        In his thesis Wise considered {\em VH-complexes}, these are square complexes with the edge set split into two disjoint sets such that attaching maps alternate between them. Among other items, Wise showed that from a VH-complex you can extract two splittings (vertical and horizontal) of it's fundamental group.
    \item Guirardel Core
    
        A particularly nice example comes from interpreting the algebraic definition of a group splitting topologically. First, specialize to the case of cyclic splittings of a fixed surface group. In this special case splittings correspond to homotopy classes of simply closed curves on a surface. The splittings further correspond to actions on trees and taking the diagonal action we get an action on a product of trees. Guirardel's work applies to more general \(\mathbb{R}\)-trees but in this case the {\em Guirardel core} is a contractible cocompact square complex - in fact, the quotient recovers the surface as a square complex with a number of squares equal to the intersection number of the curves.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{VH implies at most two actions:}

We want to show the following statement or similar: if a group is the fundamental group of a VH-complex, then there are at most two pairwise inequivalent actions on locally finite trees with FP vertex stabilizers. The following proof sketch uses or builds on VH-complexes introduced by Wise, Guirardel's core, and a theorem of Bieri. To start we have that \(G = \pi_1(K)\) where \(K\) is a VH-complex; according to Wise this comes with a vertical and horizontal splitting. For sake of a contradiction suppose there was a third tree as above. A generalization of Guirardel's core to three actions would imply that our \(G\) was the fundamental group of a VHD-complex (here ``D'' is for ``depth'') which would further imply, among other things, that our group splits along groups of cohomological dimension two. (This is analagous to Wise's work on VH-complexes) However, a theorem of Bieri and local finiteness forces the cohomological dimension of the resulting group to be dimension three which contradicts our original VH assumption so there are at most two such actions.


\section{Timeline}

The precise details of the lemmas and definitions still need to be worked out in full. (e.g. crafting a version of Guirardel's core for three instead of two trees requires work) That said, I plan to begin writing my thesis in the Summer with the intent of graduating in the Spring of 2020.

\section{Career}
I've decided that the most important factor in my next career opportunity is location. Given this, I've been focusing on industry and government jobs. I have a resume and a GitHub account with examples of my work. I've also talked to  friends and family - including some OU gradautes - who work in areas I would enjoy.

\subsection{Recovering actions in dimension 2:}

Wise obtained splittings from a VH-complex, we want a kind of converse. Consider a group of cohomological dimension two that has two actions on locally finite trees with FP vertex stabilizers. Suppose further that these actions are not in the same deformation space. We want to conclude our group is the fundamental group of a compact VH-complex and moreover the actions coming from Wise's work recover our original actions.

To begin consider the diagonal action of our group on the tree product - a square complex, in fact it has a natural VH structure where vertical (horizontal) edges correspond to edges in the first (second) tree. The diagonal action preserves edges in each tree and so preserves the VH structure. We first need to show that this action is free. (...)

Once we have a free action we introduce the Guirardel core, an invariant, simply-connected, cocompact subcomplex of the tree product that depends on our two actions. This implies that we have the fundamental group of a compact VH-complex as needed.

Lastly, we want to recover our original actions. The two actions from Wise's work come from considering our complex as a graph of spaces where the edge spaces are roughly the hyperplanes crossing the vertical edges. Then similarly for horizontal edges. (That these hyperplanes are separating and injective on fundamental group comes from conditions verified by Wise, that they are two-sided follows from the fact that our tree actions are without edge inversions) With the vertical and horizontal actions in hand we need to show they match our original actions. (...)

\section{Progress}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Freeness of product action:

	    We're going to walk through the setup in the two dimensional case. Let \(G\) be a group with two locally finite type \(FP\) actions \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\) lying in different deformation spaces.  Consider the diagonal action on \(T_{1} \times T_{2}\), we will show that this action is free. {\color{mypink1}We will show that for a given \(g \in G\) that if \(g\) fixed a point in one tree then it doesn't fix a point in the other. By symmetry suppose \(g\) fixes a point in \(T_{1}\). Consider \(G_{v}\) where \(v\) lies in \(T_{1}\), as a subgroup of \(G\) it also acts on \(T_{2}\). Suppose that \(G_{v}\) acts without a global fixed point on \(T_{2}\) then }
    \item Hyperplane separability:
        Note that hyperplanes in the tree product are dual to edges in its one-skeleton and we have a diagonal action without edge inversions.
    \item Using Bieri: If a group \(G\) has geometric dimension \(n\) and acts on a locally finite tree with \(FP_\infty\) (i.e. finite dimensional \(K(G,1)\)) stabilizers then the stabilizers have geometric dimension \(\leq n-1\).
    \item Using Howsen
    \item Using ``Quadrant-Convex'' lemma of Guirardel 
    \item Using injectivity lemma for maps of NPC complexes
    \item other: relevant facts on locally finite trees
\end{enumerate};

\section{VH-complexes}

Let \(X\) be our complex and \(X_{V}\) be the set of vertical edges. We say gates are connected components of \(X_{V}\) and corridors are cc of \(X - X_{V}\). The complex \(X\) is clean if the attaching maps of the corridors are injective.

\begin{thm}[Wise]
	If \(X\) a complete, VH, clean, connected complex then there is a finite sheeted cover that's a graph product.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
	If \(X\) is NPC, VH, compact, nice(???) then \(X\) is complete XOR contains a locally geodesic VH pair of lollipops
\end{thm}

\section{Definitions}
\begin{defn}[Graph - Abstract]
	An {\em Abstract Graph} \(\Gamma\) is a set \((V,E, \partial, i)\) where \(V\) and \(E\) are non-empty sets and \(\partial: E \to V\) and \(i: E \to E\) are functions satisfying \(i^2(e)=e\) and \(i(e) \neq e\) for all \(e \in E\). (i.e. the function \(i\) is a fixed-point free involution)
	
\end{defn}

We set \(o(e) := \partial(e)\) and \(t(e) := (\partial\circ i)(e)\) for origin and terminal vertices and put \(\overline{e} := i(e)\). We call the orbits of \(i\) the {\em undirected edges} of \(G\). (i.e. the set \(\{ e, \overline{e}\}\) is an undirected edge) 

\begin{defn}
	A tree action \((G,T)\) is {\em minimal} if it contains no proper invariant subtree. A graph of groups \(\mathcal{G}\) is minimal if there is no proper subgroup carrying the entire group.
	
\end{defn}


\begin{defn}[Collapse Move]
	If we have a group \(G\) acting on a tree \(T\) with an edge \(e\) such that \(G_{e} = G_{v}\) where \(v=o(e)\) and \(o(e)\) and \(t(e)\) are in different \(G\)-orbits then we can form \(T_{e}\) a new tree with \(V(T_{e} )=V(T)\smallsetminus G t(e)\) and \(E(T_{e} )=E(T) \smallsetminus Ge\). Then for all edges \(f\) with \(o(f) = t(ge)\) for some \(g \in G\) we define \(o(f)=gv\) in \(T_{e}\). 
	
	(Alternatively, if \(q\) was the map that paired the inital and terminal vertices of \(g e\) and left the others alone then we could define the new tree by taking \(E(T_{e} ):=E(T)\smallsetminus Ge \) and \(V(T_{e} ):=q(V)\) with attaching map \(q \circ \partial\).

	If \(\mathcal{G}\) is a graph of groups decomposition of \(G\) with \(\varphi_{e}: G_{e} \to G_{\partial e}\) an isomorphism then define \(\mathcal{G}_{e}\) by removing \(e\), \(\overline{e}\) and \(\partial e\) and for every edge \(f\) with \(\partial(f) = \partial(e)\) replace \(\varphi_{f}\) with \(\varphi_{\overline{e}} \circ \varphi_{e}^{-1} \circ \varphi_{f}\) and set \(\partial f = \partial \overline{e}\). This corresponds to taking the edge \(e\) from the tree description above and folding \([e]\) in the graph.

\end{defn}
\begin{defn}[Fold]
	Given a tree with \(\partial e = \partial f\) identify \(e\) with \(f\) as well as \(\overline{e}\) and \(\overline{f}\) and \(\overline{\partial} e\) with \(\overline{\partial} f\) and do so equivariantly. (In \(\mathcal{G}\) this corresponds to moves of type A or B with subtype I, II, or III.)
\end{defn}

\begin{claim*} A reduced not locally finite tree remains not locally finite after folding.
\end{claim*}
