- General GOS nonsense gives "Scott-Wall" maps to underlying trees, VH details gives that the product is actually an embedding
- It is true that the Scott-Wall maps are just the embedding from Wise followed by projections
- We need the action of G on C to be PD. Locally finite cell complex plus free gives us PD
- Note: Freeness of the acton means that it covers it's quotient
- We also need to satisfy the "intrinsic GOS" decomposition. We need the "slide map" of the edge space to be injective on fundamental group.
- If a composition is injective then so is the final map, use this to see that if all edge groups inject then edge groups inject into the vertex groups. QQ: why do we need this again?
- For VHD define it so that links are tripartite simplicial graphs. Remark: Wise assumed NPC and attains bipartite simplicial. Lemma should imply that the parallel properties hold
- Group for which the statement is false: ZxZ, Deformation spaces correspond to slopes correspond to homotopty types of s.c.c. on a torus
- minimal crossings = squares in Guirardel core.
