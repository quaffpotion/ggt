# Todo
- [ ] Write outline in rooted tree form
    - [x] State wrap up lemmas
    - [ ] Formally state each node in tree
    - [ ] Prove the 4,7 to 6 implication (arrive at core having connected 1-dim fibers)
    - [ ] Use Lemmas to prove main statement
- [ ] Show our setup matches the hypotheses for the combinatorial lemma
    - [x] (Lemma 4) Path in positive halfspace lemma (cf: 10/1 notes)
    - [ ] Define subpaths formally
    - [ ] Existence of subpaths in vertical factor from original path implies a path in the filled set.
- [ ] Setup for the combinatorial lemma is invariant under snipping procedure (cf: 10/1 notes)
