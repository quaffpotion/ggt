# Part 1

## Need
- [ ] Recovering action
- [ ] Obtain splittings
## Argued
- [ ] R^2 filling lemma
- [ ] R^3 filling lemma
- [ ] R^3 switching lemma
- [ ] Two trees filling lemma
- [ ] Three trees filling lemma
- [ ] lem1: Planar subargument for trees
- [x] Reduce lem1 to to tree coloring lemma lem2 (resolved: take all paths to be combinatorial from the start)
	- [x] (depreciated) Define usual retraction formally
	- [x] Upper plane only argument
	- [x] workaround connected components (e.g. infinitely colored) parts
- [ ] lem2: tree coloring lemma
	- [x] state
	- [ ] prove
- [ ] Prove K > 0 to K' must have K' > 0.
