# Todo
- [ ] Formally state each node in tree
- [ ] Write outline in rooted tree form
    - [x] State wrap up lemmas
    - [ ] Use Lemmas to prove main statement
- [ ] Show our setup plus the combinatorial lemma gives the needed path
    - [ ] Argue that WLOG we can take a path whose middle tree coordinates are in only one halfspace.
- [ ] Argue that the setup for the combinatorial lemma is invariant under our snipping procedure
