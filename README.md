# Todo
- [ ] Write down why Rxy = Ryx
- [ ] Write up lemma that gives a G-map from a free action on a 2-complex and an action on a tree.
- [ ] Write down why connected coordinate planes are homeomorphic to the fibers of the coordinate functions
- [ ] Write down connected fibers argument, uses continuous function a(t)/(a(t)+b)
- [ ] Write down argument that if S has bounded fibers then so does Sx, can't reuse same climbing section type argument, think about first and last times the path is projected to a given point. 
- [ ] Prove that fibers are bounded
- [ ] Compute torus splitting example
- [ ] Think about why there must be at least one hierarchy of non-trivial splittings
- [ ] Find proof that elliptic subgroup containment implies equality for locally finite trees
