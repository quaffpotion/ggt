# To Write
- [ ] One skeleton a union of forests and VH gives you a free face (2d version)
    - [x] Prove that hyperplanes are graphs with rank
- [ ] Rxy = Ryx
- [ ] lemma that gives a G-map from a free action on a 2-complex and an action on a tree.
- [ ] connected coordinate planes are homeomorphic to the fibers of the coordinate functions
- [ ] connected fibers argument, uses continuous function a(t)/(a(t)+b)
- [ ] argument that if S has bounded fibers then so does Sx, can't reuse same climbing section type argument, think about first and last times the path is projected to a given point. 
- [ ] elliptic subgroup containment implies equality for locally finite trees
- [ ] argue that the bad case is all trees in lower splittings

# To prove
- [ ] fibers are bounded
- [ ] there must be at least one hierarchy of non-trivial splittings; try to show that not all final splittings can be trees

# To compute
- [ ] torus splitting example
