# To Write
- [ ] elliptic subgroup containment implies equality for locally finite trees
- [ ] Getting invariant projection maps from the VH-splittings.
- [ ] coordinate planes are homeomorphic to the fibers of the coordinate functions
    - [ ] review
- [ ] write connected fibers argument, uses continuous function a(t)/(a(t)+b)
    - [x] prove connected fibers argument, uses continuous function a(t)/(a(t)+b)
    - [ ] review
- [ ] lemma that gives a G-map from a free action on a 2-complex and an action on a tree.
    - [ ] Part 1: Construct equivariant map
        - [x] Define map on 0-cells and 1-cells
        - [ ] Need details on standard 2-cell to tripod fibration.
    - [ ] Part 2: Fibration details
- [ ] Obtain the main corollary (that the core has simply connected hyperplanes) from the results so far. (This will be `part 1` and should come from refactoring the wrap up lemmas)
- [ ] One skeleton a union of forests and VH gives you a free face (2d, 3d version)
    - [x] Prove that hyperplanes are graphs with rank in 2d case, in 3d case hyp of hyp are graphs with rank
    - [ ] Prove that these hyperplanes (in either case) embedd or cause a problem with a global condition.
- [x] Rxy = Ryx
    - [x] Explain how we use Guirardel to get QH(R) subset Rxy.
    - [x] Write up Rxy subset QH(R).
- [ ] argument that if S has bounded fibers then so does Sx, can't reuse same climbing section type argument, think about first and last times the path is projected to a given point. 
- [ ] argue that the bad case is all trees in lower splittings

# To prove
- [ ] fibers are bounded
- [ ] there must be at least one hierarchy of non-trivial splittings; try to show that not all final splittings can be trees

# To compute
- [ ] torus splitting example
