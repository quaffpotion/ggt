# Todo
- [ ] Write down why Rxy = Ryx
- [ ] Write down why connected coordinate planes are homeomorphic to the fibers of the coordinate functions
- [ ] Write down connected fibers argument, uses continuous function a(t)/(a(t)+b)
- [ ] Write down argument that if S has bounded fibers then so does Sx, can't reuse same climbing section argument, think about first and last times the path is projected to a given point. 
- [ ] Prove that fibers are bounded
- [ ] Write up torus splitting example
